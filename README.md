# Automated-Stuffs 💻
Things I could do in 10 minutes, but I spent 10 hours automating them 😎 (Not actually 😉)

> May be you won't find anything interesting here, I'm storing them on github to use later or I might need any help from those.

* __Khatian Downloader__
  * I saw one of my uncle copying pages from [ভার্চুয়াল রেকর্ডরুম](http://drr.land.gov.bd/) one by one and pesting them on a excel file, so that he can find something easily by searching in one place. As that website doesn't support searching. There was around 1000 pages for each area, around 200 area for each upazilla. So for each upazilla he had to copy-paste almost 200,000 pages.
So I wrote him an simple script which can download and arrange all pages from a single upazilla using only one command.
* __Screenshot Taker__
  * A python script to take screenshot of any website in any desired size. Detailed documentation is available [here](/ScreenshotTaker/Doc.md).
