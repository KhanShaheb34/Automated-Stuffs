  * I saw one of my uncle copying pages from [‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ö‡ßÅ‡ßü‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶°‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶Æ](http://drr.land.gov.bd/) one by one and pesting them on a excel file, so that he can find something by easily searching in one place. As that website doesn't support searching. There was around 1000 pages for each area, around 200 area for each upazilla. So for each upazilla he had to copy-paste almost 200,000 pages.
So I wrote him an script which can download and arrange all pages from a single upazilla using only one command.
